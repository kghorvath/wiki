====== Hyper-V Server ======

A stripped down version of Windows Server Core meant to function only as a Hyper-V server. 2019 was the last iteration released by Microsoft.

===== As a Desktop =====

With a little bit of coaxing, Hyper-V Server 2019 can be used as a full desktop OS.

==== Enable Application Compatibility ====

Run the following command to enable running regular Win32 programs:

''Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name ServerCore.AppCompatibility~~~~0.0.1.0''

==== Set the Default Shell ====

By default, Hyper-V Server will just load a CMD window on login. We can change that via the registry.

''HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\AlternateShells\AvailableShells'' is the the key that lists the priority of shells that Windows will load on logon. By default, ''cmd.exe'' is set with a priority of 3000.

In order to edit the ''AvailableShells'' key, take ownership of it by right clicking it > Permissions > Advanced > and changing the owner from *TrustedInstaller* to yourself.

Add a new string with a value higher than 3000 and the data with ''explorer.exe''.

==== Add a Start Menu ====

The built-in explorer doesn't have a start menu. Use a third party one such as [[https://github.com/Open-Shell/Open-Shell-Menu|Open-Shell.]]
