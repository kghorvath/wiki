====== Windows 95 ======


===== Upgrade Bypass =====

Like Windows 95, Windows 95 has separate editions for full and upgrade installs.

Windows 95 stores edition information in SETUPPP.INF in PRECOPY2.CAB under ''[ProductType]'' and upgrade information in SETUPC.INF in ''[Data]''

=== Product Type ===
^ Value ^ Edition ^ Key ^ Notes ^
| 1 | Internal | None | Microsoft use |
| 2 | Retail | Retail | Retail CD Full/Upgrade |
| 3 | Upgrade | Upgrade | Upgrade Floppy. Writes Name and Company to the Floppy. |
| 4 | Retail | Retail | Floppy |
| 5 | Unused | N/A | Setup runs from DOS but fails at reading setup options. |
| 6 | Unused | N/A | Setup runs from DOS/3.1. Product key has ignore option. |
| 7 | Unused | N/A | Setup runs from DOS but fails at reading setup options. |
| 8 | OEM | OEM | OEM Floppy. No Upgrade. |
| 9 | OEM | OEM | OEM CD. No Upgrade. |

=== Upgrade Type ===

^ CCP=<value> ^ Description ^
| 0 | No Upgrade |
| 1 | Compliance Checking Program (Checks for Upgrade) |

==== Setup Switches ====

Windows 95 Setup allows passing switches from the DOS prompt.

^ Switch ^ Description ^
| /? | Prints a list of switches |
| /c | Setup will not run SMARTdrive |
| /d | Setup will not use existing Windows configuration (WIN.INI and SYSTEM.INI) |
| /id | Skips check for available free space |
| /ig | Runs setup for older Gateway/Micron computers with early BIOS versions |
| /ih | Runs Scandisk in the foreground |
| /im | Skips conventional memory check |
| /iq | Skips Scandisk check but does check for cross-linked files |
| /is | Skips Scandisk check |
| /it | Skips check for TSR (Terminate and stay resident) programs |
| /ir | Undocumented switch. Skips writing to the boot sector. Setup will not reboot at the end and will require a startup disk to write to the boot sector to continue installation. Intended for BIOSes with boot-sector virus protection that cannot be disabled. |
| /IW | Skips license agreement |
| /l | Use a Logitech mouse with setup |
| /n | Run setup without a mouse |
| /nr | Skips registry check |
| /t:<dir> | Specify a location for setup temporary files |
| -s | Use a different SETUP.INF |

The ''/p'' switch can pass additional options to Detection Manager:

^ Switch ^ Description ^
| /p a | Enables safe hardware detection |
| /p b | Prompt before mode. Prompts before each detection mode. |
| /p c | Class detection mode. //Class detection is a mechanism 
for finding hints for a certain class of devices. For example, adapter 
class detection looks for hints in the config.sys and System.ini files for 
CD-ROM drivers. If it does not find any, Setup displays a CD-ROM check box 
asking if you have a CD-ROM drive.// |
| /p c- | Disables class detection mode |
| /p d=<name> | Detects listed modules only |
| /p e | Enables setup mode detection |
| /p f | Enables clean registry mode. Cleans the root branch of the registry before starting. |
| /p g-<value> | Controls verbosity level of the detection progress bar. //At
maximum level (3), it shows all the resources of the detected devices along 
with the progress bar. This switch can help to identify which detection 
module causes a certain problem. For example, if your mouse stops 
responding (hangs) during detection but the system continues, there is no 
way to determine from the log files which module hung the mouse. By turning 
this option on and constantly moving the mouse during Setup, you can 
determine which module is running when the mouse hangs.// |
| /p i | Tells setup to not report the existence of a Plug-and-Play BIOS |
| /p j | Tells setup to undo the result of ''/p i'' |
| /p l=<value> | Sets logging level of DETLOG.TXT where ''3'' is max verbosity |
| /p m | Enables mini-Windows mode |
| /p n | Disables safe recovery |
| /p o=<file> | Specifies trace output file location |
| /p p | Enables performance logging to DETLOG.TXT |
| /p r | Enables Safe Recovery |
| /p s=<name> | Skips listed detection modules |
| /p t=<value> | Specifies trace level, from 0-9 |
| /p v | Enables verify only mode. Skips detection and only verifies existing hardware in the registry. |
| /p x | Excludes listed resources from detection |


===== QEMU/KVM Notes =====

==== Pre-Installation Notes ====

The CD-ROM drive sometimes doesn't show up after first reboot. In order to continue installation, be sure to copy the install files to the hard drive first. Somewhere like C:\Win95.

Be sure to patch the installation files too with [[https://github.com/JHRobotics/patcher9x|Patcher9x]] before installation.
