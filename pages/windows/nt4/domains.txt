===== Corrupt DHCP Database =====

The DHCP server may fail to start if the database becomes corrupt. An indication is an event in the Event Log like this:

  Event ID: 1014
  Source: DhcpServer
  Type: Error
  Description: The Jet database returned the following Error: -1022
  
To fix it, perform the following steps:

  - Stop the DHCP Service with ''net stop dhcpserver''
  - Replace the DB file at ''%SYSTEMROOT%\system32\dhcp\dhcp.mdb'' with its backup from ''%SYSTEMROOT%\system32\dhcp\backup\jet\new\dhcp.mdb''
  - Restart the DHCP server with ''net start dhcpserver''

If this doesn't work, you may need to delete the entire ''%SYSTEMROOT%\system32\dhcp'' folder.
