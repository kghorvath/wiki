====== Windows 98 ======


===== Setup =====

==== Upgrade Bypass ====

Windows 98 normally won't let you upgrade with an OEM or Retail copy - you'd need to use a special Upgrade version. There's a few ways we can get around this.

=== Method 1: Rename SETUPX.DLL ===
  - Navigate to C:\Windows\System on your existing 95/98 install.
  - Rename SETUPX.DLL to something else like SETUPX.OLD.
  - Start setup and proceed as normal.

=== Method 2: Edit SETUPX.DLL ===
  - You'll need to make a directory on your hard disk like C:\Win98 and copy the setup files there.
  - Open SETUPX.DLL from the installation files in a hex editor.
  - Go to the end of the file where you'll see something like 0.120.......File Copy Engine...
  - The 120 indicates the edition type as noted below. Change it to your desired edition.
  - Save the file and start setup from the copied directory.

^ Value ^ Edition ^ Key ^ Notes ^

| 110 | Select | Some Retail | Precursor to Volume License |
| 111 | MSDN | MSDN | |

| 103 | Retail | Retail | Retail Floppy |

===== QEMU/KVM Notes =====

==== Pre-Installation Notes ====

The CD-ROM drive sometimes doesn't show up after first reboot. In order to continue installation, be sure to copy the install files to the hard drive first. Somewhere like C:\Win98.

Be sure to patch the installation files too with [[https://github.com/JHRobotics/patcher9x|Patcher9x]] before installation.

==== Enabling PCI Support ====

To enable PCI hardware detection in QEMU/KVM:
  - Open Device Manager
  - Right click Plug & Play BIOS and click Properties
  - Select Update Driver, then Display All Drivers, then select PCI Bus.
  - Reboot
